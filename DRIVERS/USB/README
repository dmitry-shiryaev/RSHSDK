To install driver for Rudnev-Shilyaev devices do the following:
1. Go to LAUSB directory and run 'make' command.
   NOTE: you will need kernel headers. If you don't have them installed or don't know what kernel headers are, 
         do the following: 
			   sudo apt-get update
                           sudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r)
	 If you are running Linux other than Debian/Ubuntu, use Google to find appropriate way to install kernel headers on 
         your system.
2. Go to USBInstallDriver directory and run 'sudo bash install'
3. Check for errors and contact us on soft@rudshel.ru if necessary. If no errors occured, reboot and you are ready to use Rudnev-Shilyaev devices.
